# Password-Generator-Project

For this project, I utilized Python's random to create a script that creates a random password for the user. The password created is based on three lists each containing numbers, symbols, and letters. When running the program will ask the user how many numbers, symbols, and letters they want in their password, and then the user's input will be used to create a random password with the help of the random library.
